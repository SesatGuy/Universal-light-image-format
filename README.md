# Universal Light Image Format (.ULIF)
Just random image format in python cuz why not

# Why UNIF is the name of this format?
Simple!

* Universal = Only 1 program support this
* Light = this thing heavy
* Image = Indeed a image
* Format = format. idk what to say

Indeed this project is a hypocrite
